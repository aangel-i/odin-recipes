    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
          This is a recipe I found on the internet. It is an Indonesian cuisine which 
          has a sweet and salty taste.
      </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>1kg chicken</li>
          <li>5 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
          <li>1 large onion thinly sliced</li>
          <li>4 cloves garlic minced</li>
          <li>2 inch fresh ginger grated</li>
          <li>5 tablespoon kecap manis</li>
          <li>2 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
          <li>2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce or oyster sauce</li>
          <li>1 stalk green onion finely chopped</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Place the chicken wings in a large bowl. Add salt, pepper, and oil. 
              Mix to make sure the chicken pieces are seasoned. Covered and let it 
              marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 12 hours in the refrigerator</li>
          <li>Cook the chicken in any way you desire e.g. bake or deep-fry the chicken</li>
          <li>Mix all the seasonings ingredients in a bowl and set aside. Melt butter in a large wok 
              or skillet. Add onion, garlic, and ginger. Stir fry until the onion has turned soft 
              and translucent, about 5 minutes or so</li>
          <li>Add the chicken pieces followed by seasonings. Stir to mix to make sure the sauce 
              is coating the chicken pieces evenly. Have a taste. It should be more on the sweet side. 
              Add more kecap manis if needed</li>
          <li>Sprinkle in the chopped green onion and stir to mix. Remove from the heat and transfer to a serving platter. Serve immediately</li>
      </ol>
