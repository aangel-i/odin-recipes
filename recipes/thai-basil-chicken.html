   <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>
         This is a recipe I found on the internet. I have made it
         multiple times with my whole family enjoying it. I usually
         don't follow the recipe to the dot, often modifying it depending
         on what I have.
     </p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>200g boneless chicken (any cut)</li>
         <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
         <li>4-10 chillies (depending on preferred spicy level)</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon oyster sauce</li>
         <li>1/2 teaspoon light soy sauce</li>
         <li>A splash of dark sweet soy sauce (e.g. Indonesian kecap manis)</li>
         <li>1 handful Thai holy basil leaves (DO NOT get Italian basil)</li>
     </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
         <li>Cut the chicken into small bite sized pieces</li>
         <li>Rinse and peel the garlic and chilies, and pound them in a
             mortar and pestle (alternatively you can just mince them with a knife)</li>
         <li>Pluck a good sized handful of holy basil leaves off the stems</li>
         <li>Heat your wok on high heat, and add about 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan</li>
         <li>When the oil is hot, add the chilies and garlic. Stir fry them for about 20 
             seconds or so until they get really fragrant, but don't let them burn or get too dry.</li>
         <li>Toss in your chicken. Keep stir frying continuously. At this stage you want to continue 
             to stir and cook your chicken until it's just about fully cooked all the way through</li>
         <li>Add 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce, ½ teaspoon light soy sauce, ½ teaspoon sugar, and finally a splash of dark soy sauce. Keep stir frying for about another 30 seconds.</li>
         <li>Grab a handful of holy basil, toss it into the pan, fold it into the chicken, and then immediately turn off the heat. 
             The holy basil really only needs to cook for about 5 seconds, and it will continue to wilt and cook from the existing heat of the chicken. 
             This step is important because if you cook the basil for too long, it loses some of its glorious flavor and gets slightly chewy.</li>
